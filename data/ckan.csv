City of Toronto Open Data Portal,"The City of Toronto launched its first Open Data Portal in the fall of 2009 to meet growing demand for open data. Since then, the open data movement has gained increasing momentum within Toronto’s digital and civic spaces. As a result, open data currently serves as a politically charged topic of discussion within civic decision-making as policymakers and the civic community navigate open data policies and address socio-political and technical barriers.

The evolution of technology and data literacy mean, however, that in addition to increasing demand for data, expectations for a broader set of functionality have changed as well. This includes being able to visualize data, being able to download data in non-proprietary formats, and meeting accessibility compliance requirements. These factors have necessitated a redesign effort, which is the Open Data Portal Sandbox you are currently on.

When we started designing the new portal, we spoke to the individuals best informed to direct how it should function. Our open data community is a passionate one; it includes developers, policymakers, academics and civic advocates. These communities mobilize around a common goal: that some data should be freely available for everyone to use and re-publish as they wish. When data is freely available, it can innovated upon by anyone to draw insights and use evidence to inform the design of civic services. The open data portal aims to do just this.", Toronto,https://portal0.cf.opendata.inter.sandbox-toronto.ca/

parchemins,"Présentation du projet
La Bretagne, terrain d’étude privilégié
La Bretagne est une région dans laquelle l’agriculture littorale est confrontée à des pressions et à des remises en cause multiples : les crises répétées qui touchent des filières animales et légumières, les inquiétudes et critiques associées aux pollutions diffuses d’origine agricole, les tensions sur l’installation et la pression foncière, y font de l’agriculture littorale une question socialement vive.

Malgré la forte implication des institutions pour co-construire des perspectives d’évolution avec les différentes parties prenantes, les contraintes qui entourent la prise de parole des agriculteurs dans le débat public sont très fortes. Le projet vise de ce fait à concevoir, expérimenter et consolider des espaces de délibération et de problématisation sur la place de l’activité agricole dans les territoires littoraux, qui soient ouverts et en même temps préservés des contraintes qui accompagnent l’opérationnalisation des politiques publiques locales. Les connaissances et dynamiques qui en découlent sont ainsi susceptibles de compléter utilement les dispositifs institutionnels de concertation et de nourrir, dans le long terme, la réflexion, les stratégies et les projets des acteurs locaux.

Le projet PARCHEMINS prend appui sur l’expérience de trois projets de recherche portant sur l’agriculture littorale et les pollutions diffuses d’origine agricole, réalisés entre 2009 et 2014. Ceux-ci ont montré qu’il existe un écart important entre la conscience très partagée de la dimension éminemment sociale et politique des problèmes rencontrés par l’agriculture littorale et le caractère lacunaire des données de recherche produites et rendues disponibles à ce sujet.

 

Trois objectifs opérationnels
Sur 5 territoires littoraux présentant des caractéristiques distinctes, identifier les dynamiques spécifiques à l’agriculture littorale et rendre compte de leur diversité, en explorant les bases de données disponibles et en les analysant à la lumière de données qualitatives issues d’enquêtes ethnographiques ;
Rendre disponible et vivante auprès d’une large audience la parole et l’expérience des agriculteurs travaillant en zone littorale, dans leur diversité ;
Créer des espaces de rencontre et de dialogue informels entre agriculteurs et autres groupes sociaux et professionnels impliqués dans la compréhension, la problématisation, la critique, la gouvernance de l’agriculture sur le littoral.
Pour répondre à ces objectifs, le projet se structure en 6 axes de recherche, animés par les membres de l’équipe scientifique.

 

Un projet de recherche collaboratif
PARCHEMINS est fondé sur l’implication de chercheurs relevant de différentes disciplines et sur un partenariat fort avec les acteurs institutionnels locaux et la société civile. Le projet reconnaît aux savoirs d’expérience un vrai statut dans la conduite de la recherche. Cela implique, pour l’équipe porteuse, une ouverture à la diversité des formes de problématisation opérées par les acteurs sociaux et une capacité à les restituer et à les articuler avec ses propres questions de recherche. Cette posture est à l’origine du choix des trois principaux outils d’opérationnalisation de la recherche retenus par les partenaires:

la production documentaire, qui s’appuie principalement sur le partenariat avec un réseau de radios associatives locales;
la mise en place d’un site Internet laissant une large place à l’expression libre et au commentaire sur les données produites;
la co-construction avec les enseignants d’écoles d’agronomie d’outils pédagogiques."," Brittany, France",http://ckan.parchemins.bzh/
